I’m interested in optimizing course selection at UBC as well as integrating the data that is available on science specializations.

I’m currently learning how the hell to do that, currently attempting to use Excel because that's what I am good at.

I would love to collaborate if you want to help, as of now, I have 3 things that could be helped with:
  1) If you know how to efficiently use powerquery and pivot tables for large datasets (500,000+ rows.)
  2) If you want to help manually rip the individual grades from PAIR
  3) You can write code to do that automatically.

If you are interested:  0trolley_muses@icloud.com (forwards to me)
